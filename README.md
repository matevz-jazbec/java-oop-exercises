# Java OOP Exercises

These are study exercises from university coursework.  
Solutions implemented by me as part of coursework.

## Purpose

This repository is intended for **learning and practice**.  
Each exercise folder contains a short README with the original assignment. **Read the assignment first and try to solve it yourself**, then compare your approach with the provided Java solution. The Java source file in each folder is a simple reference implementation that satisfies the minimum requirements.

## Contents

This repository contains simple object‑oriented programming exercises in Java.

1. **Exam** (folder: `exam-task`)  
   - Classes: `Task`, `Exam`  
   - Demonstrates encapsulation, constructors, getters, setters, and basic iteration.  
   - Includes a `main` method that creates exam tasks and prints their details.

2. **Subject – Schedule** (folder: `subject-schedule`)  
   - Classes: `Subject`, `Schedule`  
   - Demonstrates use of objects in collections (`ArrayList`), iteration, encapsulation, and simple aggregation.  
   - Includes a `main` method that creates a schedule with subjects and prints results.

## How to Use

1. Open one exercise folder (`exam-task` or `subject-schedule`).  
2. Read the exercise README to see the assignment.  
3. Implement your own solution (you can create a new `.java` file).  
4. Compare with the reference implementation provided in the folder.  
5. Optionally, modify the input data in `main` to experiment further.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher recommended).
2. In a terminal, navigate to the chosen exercise folder.
3. Compile and run, for example:  
   ```bash
   # Exam
   javac Exam.java
   java Exam
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   # Subject – Schedule
   javac Schedule.java
   java Schedule
   ```
4. The program will display results in the console.
